##regex
http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp
/.../ is a regular expression in js
\s and \s+ is for spaces, \s+ for multiple spaces
from stack overflow:
	var str = '#this #is__ __#a test###__';
	str.replace(/#|_/g,''); // result: "this is a test"
	You could also use a character class:
	str.replace(/[#_]/g,'');

_ is a valid variable identifier in JavaScript, and could theoretically refer to anything. Using _(...) with function syntax implies that _ is a function.
